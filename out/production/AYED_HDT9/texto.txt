GUATEMALA
Located in northern Central America, Guatemala borders with Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Belize. It is the most populous Central American country with over 15 million inhabitants, 60% of which have indigenous roots. The Guatemalan culture is rooted deep in ancient Mayan and Spanish influences. The official language is Spanish, although there are 22 Mayan languages officially recognized by the state.
Guatemala is a country of volcanoes, mountains, and beaches on the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. From the Cuchamat√°n Mountains in the western highlands, to the coastlines on the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, this small country is marked by contrasts.
